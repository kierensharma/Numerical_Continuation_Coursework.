# Numerical Continuation Library

## Project Description
Repository for EMAT30008 Scientific Computing - Numerical continuation coursework. 

## Description
This software serves as a general numerical continuation library, with some of the following capabilities;
* OSE Solver - used for approximating the solutions of ordinary differential equation (ODE) initial value problems (IVP), through use of explicit iterative methods .
* Numerical Shooting -  used for approximating the solutions to ODE boundary value problems (BVP).
* Natural Parameter Continuation (using Pseudo-arclength) - used to track the respective limit cycles or steady-states within the system, providing useful insights into bifurcations and stable/critical points
* PDE Solver - used to find the solutions to PDE initial value problems (IVP), through use of finite-difference methods.
